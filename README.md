# AITicTacToe

[Issaquah High School Code Club 2017]

One of the many projects completed through my leadership of the Issaquah High School Code Club. This specific excersise required the club members to develop an ubeatable game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java. 

This was one of the example pieces I created for the class.
